# Anankix

**Pronunciation:** `uh-NAN-kix` (/əˈnæŋkɪks/), with the emphasis on the second syllable.

Anankix is an open-source, cloud-native control plane designed for managing and orchestrating distributed physical infrastructure such as DePIN, IoT, and Edge networks. Built on the Kubernetes Operator pattern, Anankix extends the power of Kubernetes beyond the cloud to the physical world.

It allows you to model your physical devices as Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRDs), providing a unified and declarative API to automate the complete lifecycle management of large-scale hardware fleets.

Anankix bridges the gap between cloud-native principles and physical infrastructure, transforming your collection of devices into a single cohesive, programmable, and observable system.
